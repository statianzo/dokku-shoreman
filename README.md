# dokku-shoreman

dokku-shoreman is a plugin for [dokku][dokku] that injects a stripped down
version of [shoreman][shoreman], a Procfile runner written in bash.

Normally, dokku only runs the `web` process within Procfile. The dokku-shoreman
plugin will run all process types (web, worker, etc.) and stop them all together.

## Installation

###previous versions (0.3.x and below)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/statianzo/dokku-shoreman.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/dokku-shoreman
dokku plugins-install
```
###latest versions 
```sh
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/statianzo/dokku-shoreman.git
```

All future deployments will use shoreman to start all processes.

## v0.2.0 breaking change

In v0.2.0, dokku-shoreman had its pluginhook file renamed to `post-build-buildstep` to regain compatibility with upstream dokku. Users of older dokku should pin their dokku-shoreman to v0.1.x.
